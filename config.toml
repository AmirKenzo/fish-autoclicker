# Detection Filters
# ------------------

process_frame_number_threshold = 180  # RGB threshold for converting colors to 255 when detecting frame numbers.
process_frame_boxes_threshold = 70    # RGB threshold for converting colors to 255 when detecting boxes in frames.
fish_press_e_conf = 0.65
fish_press_e_delay = 0.5

# Confidence and Timing
# ---------------------
process_frame_number_conf = 0.8   # Confidence level (percentage) for detecting frame numbers.
click_delay = 0.2                 # Time delay (in seconds) after clicking each detected box.
pause_key_name = "f6"              # Key name for pausing and resuming the application

# Visual Settings
# ---------------

cs_success_color = [60, 236, 84]  # Success color for CS. Use: https://imagecolorpicker.com/en

# Monitor Settings
# ----------------
# Specify the resolution of your monitor. Use: https://pixspy.com/

height = 1440                    # Monitor height.

# Region Settings
# ---------------
# Define the region for Auto CS detection. Use: https://pixspy.com/
#
# Steps:
# 1. Take a screenshot of the target area.
# 2. Upload the screenshot to the website.
# 3. Capture the location values by right-clicking on the desired area.
#    Example: "SELECTION 1536 × 864 @ (192, 108)"
#    - Width and Height: 1536 × 864
#    - Top and Left: (192, 108)
